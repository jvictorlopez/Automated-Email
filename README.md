# Automated-Email
Python script for automatic certificate distribution via email. Built to improve efficiency in my role as an administrator for a 5G Networks course, reducing manual effort and time.

The script loads recipient data from a JSON file, attaches the corresponding PDF certificate from a specified directory, and sends out a congratulatory email. By using a simple SMTP setup with SSL security, the script was able to send emails directly from a designated email account.
